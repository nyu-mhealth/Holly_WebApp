Recreate functionality in Andrew's app: http://gis.truthinitiative.org/tobaccoviewer/   
From the Truth Initiative Tobacco Viewer About section:  

> This application was developed as a tool that allows for the examination of changes in FDA compliance check inspections over time. The tool is integrated with Truth Initiativeâ€™s GIS portal, which allows users to explore how compliance check inspections may be associated with a range of other factors. Users can quickly zoom to their local area and bookmark their preferences as they overlay various data sources and visualize the results.
